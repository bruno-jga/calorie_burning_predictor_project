# Calorie Burning Predictor

This is a simple web application that predicts the number of calories burned based on the user's age, weight, duration of exercise, heart rate, gender, etc. The application uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of exercise data obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/gym-members-exercise-dataset).

The objective of this project was to learn how to use new tools like docker and learn how to create a web application using flask. 

This work is part of the Machine Learning Zoomcamp created by Alexey Grigorev.
